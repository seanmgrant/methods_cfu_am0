# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
at first I wasn't feeling confident but after practicing and going over with peers I feel confident.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
Simple methods I feel great about.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
how can we use this in a real world scenario eg. on the web.
